        <li>1 lb. lean ground beef</li>
        <li>1 medium onion, chopped</li>
        <li>1 Tbsp minced garlic</li>
        <li>1/2 cup carrots, grated</li>
        <li>4 oz mushrooms, chopped</li>
        <li>1 lb. canned tomatoes </li>
        <li>1 Tbsp dried basil</li>
        <li>1 tsp white sugar</li>
        <li>2 1/2 tsp salt (divided)</li>
        <li>1/2 tsp thyme</li>
        <li>1/4 tsp nutmeg</li>
        <li>1 head cabbage</li>
        <li>24 oz low-fat cottage cheese</li>
        <li>1 cup Parmesan cheese, grated (divided)</li>
        <li>1 Tbsp parsley</li>
        <li>1 tsp oregano</li>
        <li>Cooking spray</li>
        <li>2 cups part-skim mozzarella cheese, grated</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Heat a large skillet over medium-high heat. Cook
             and stir ground beef, onion, and garlic in the 
             hot skillet until meat is browned and crumbly, 
             5 to 7 minutes. Drain and discard grease. Add
             carrots and mushrooms. Add tomatoes and break
             up using a fork. Add basil, sugar, 1 teaspoon
              salt, thyme, and nutmeg. Reduce heat and simmer
               meat sauce for 30 minutes.</li>
        <li>Meanwhile, bring a large pot of water to a boil.
            Immerse cabbage in the boiling water and carefully
            break off leaves. Cook until leaves are limp, about
            3 minutes. Drain.
        </li>
        <li>Combine cottage cheese, 1/2 cup Parmesan cheese, parsley, 
            1 1/2 teaspoon salt, and oregano in a bowl and set aside.
        </li>
        <li>Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Coat a 9x13-inch
            baking pan with cooking spray and place a layer of cooked cabbage
            leaves flat in the bottom.
        </li>
        <li>Reserve 1/4 cup of meat sauce. Layer half the remaining sauce on
            top of the cabbage leaves in the baking pan. Layer half of the 
            cottage cheese mixture followed by half of the mozzarella cheese.
            Add a second layer of cabbage leaves, the rest of the meat sauce,
            the remaining cottage cheese mixture, and mozzarella cheese. Sprinkle
            reserved 1/4 cup meat sauce on top and finish with 1/2 cup Parmesan cheese.
        </li>
        <li>Bake in the preheated oven for 45 minutes. Remove from the oven and let
            cool for 15 minutes before serving.
        </li>
    </ol>
