        </ul>
        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Combine beef, 1 tablespoon soy sauce, and 1 tablespoon shaoxing wine in a bowl and 
                toss to coat. Place in refrigerator and let marinate for at least 20 minutes at room
                temperature and up to 3 hours.
            </li>
            <li>Meanwhile, combine remaining soy sauce with corn starch and stir with a fork to form 
                a slurry. Add remaining shaoxing wine, chicken stock, oyster sauce, sugar, and 
                sesame oil. Set aside. Combine garlic, ginger, and scallion whites in a bowl and set 
                aside.
            </li>
            <li>When ready to cook, heat 1 tablespoon oil in a wok over high 
                heat until smoking. Add half of beef and cook without moving until well seared, about 
                1 minute. Continue cooking while stirring and tossing until lightly cooked but still pink 
                in spots, about 1 minute. Transfer to a large bowl. Repeat with 1 more tablespoon of
                oil and remaining beef, adding beef to the same bowl. Wipe out wok.
            </li>
            <li>Add 1 more tablespoon oil to wok and heat over high heat until smoking. Add half of 
                broccoli. Transfer to bowl with beef. Repeat with remaining oil and remaining broccoli.
                Return wok to high heat until smoking. Return beef and broccoli to wok and add 
                garlic/ginger/scallion mixture. Cook, tossing and stirring until fragrant, about 30 
                seconds. Add sauce and scallion greens and cook, tossing and stirring constantly 
                until lightly thickened, about 45 seconds longer. Carefully transfer to a serving platter
                and serve.
