# odin-recipes
This project is a simple recipe website that will demonstrate my html skills, file structure organization, linking files and images, and using git to push my project to github. I will use my current knowledge to set up the html boiler plate for several recipe pages and organize my text using tags such as <p> <h1> <h2> <title> <ul> <ol> <li> <a>   to build a fully funcitonal recipe website. I hope you can get some tasty recipes out of it
